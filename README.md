## 📋 Executive Summary

The **Crypto AI Intelligence Platform** aggregates multi-modal data sources (blockchain on-chain metrics, social media sentiment, and exchange order books) to provide institutional-grade market insights. 

It moves beyond simple technical analysis by incorporating **Social Volume** and **Developer Activity** metrics to gauge the fundamental health of crypto assets.

### Key Capabilities
- **Sentiment Alpha**: Real-time NLP analysis of Twitter/X and Reddit discussions using BERT/RoBERTa.
- **On-Chain Forensics**: Tracking whale wallet movements and exchange inflows/outflows.
- **Price Prediction**: LSTM-based volatility forecasting models.
- **Automated Reporting**: Daily market intelligence briefs generated by Generative AI.
